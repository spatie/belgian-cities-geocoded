# A list of all Belgian cities with their geographic coordinates 
In the csv file you'll find the names and postal codes of all Belgian cities and villages with their geographic coordinates.

The list is based on the [list of postal codes used by the Belgian Postal Services](http://www.bpost.be/site/nl/residential/customerservice/search/postal_codes.html) that was retrieved on 2015-09-11. The geocoding was done using [spatie/geocoder](https://github.com/spatie/geocoder).
